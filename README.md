SQL-Python Mini Project: GDP Analysis

Mini Project(SQL + Python + Visualizations)

Overview

This project explores global economic and demographic trends using a dataset from The Economist's October 4th, 2023 article. I used SQL and Python to analyze GDP, population aging, labor force statistics, and regional contributions to global economic output.

The notebook covers:

Economic performance by country

Demographic trends and their relation to GDP per capita

Global & regional comparisons

Exploratory regression models


Data Source

Kaggle Dataset: "The Economist: Global Economic Trends 2023"

Preprocessed CSV files for GDP, labor force, demographics, etc.


Tools & Libraries Used

SQL (via sqlite3 in Python)

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly

Scikit-learn (for linear regression)


Key Questions Answered
Economic Performance
Which countries had the highest GDP per capita in 2022?

How do nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP compare?

How has GDP per capita evolved for countries like US, China, and India?

Demographics & Labor
Does an aging population correlate with wealth?

Do top economies also show low unemployment?

Global Comparisons
How has the global average GDP per capita changed over time?

Which regions contribute the most to global GDP?

Regression Analysis
Can GDP or GDP per capita be predicted using labor force size and elderly population?

What does a log-log regression tell us about demographic influence on wealth?

Sample Visuals
Plots include:

GDP trends (line plots)

GDP per capita vs elderly population (scatter)

Global GDP growth over time

Treemap of regional GDP shares

Regression plots with log transforms


Final Insight
This project explored global economic patterns through GDP, PPP adjustments, and demographic indicators like labor force size and elderly population. High-income countries like Luxembourg and Singapore show strong economic performance and low unemployment. Regression analysis revealed that while total GDP is closely linked to labor force size, GDP per capita depends more on structural factorsâ€”older populations tend to indicate wealthier, more developed nations. Though demographic indicators explain part of the variation, economic productivity is influenced by many other factors beyond population. The analysis blends visual, SQL, and statistical insights to offer a well-rounded picture of global development trends.
