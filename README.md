# GDP & Productivity Analysis

Analysis of global productivity trends using The Economist's GDP dataset (1980-2022), revealing the relationship between national wealth, working hours, and economic efficiency.

## Key Findings

- **Productivity > Demographics**: Productivity metrics explain 98.3% of GDP variation vs. 44.6% for demographics alone
- **Work-Wealth Paradox**: Strong negative correlation (-0.55) between GDP per capita and hours worked
- **Efficiency Wins**: Norway achieves $138K per 1000 hours while Colombia works 2,405 hours annually with low productivity
